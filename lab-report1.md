# Second Step: Install Visual Studio Code

1. You might have VScode installed already for previous CS courses. If you haven't, click on the Visual Studio Code website here: [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the instructions to download VScode. 
2. After VScode is installed, try to open it. If you see a window like this, you have correctly installed VScode.

If this is your first time connecting to remote server, you might get a message asking you "...Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?". Type yes and then insert your password as instructed.
